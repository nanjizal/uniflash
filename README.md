[feffects](https://github.com/filt3rek/feffects) for tweening should also be compatible with as2 haxe ( flash8 )?

Links:

- http://old.haxe.org/forum - Old haxe forum more likely to have as2 haxe related details, my old answers were under jlm
- https://code.google.com/archive/p/actionscripttohaxe/ May have dependancies.
