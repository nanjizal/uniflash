# uniflash

Uniflash is old project that made as2 style haxe feasible.

uniflash allowed you to use flash6/7/8/9 ( as2/as3 ) using the same code.
Useful in understanding differences between avm1 ( as2 ) and avm ( as3 ) bytecode with Haxe.

[feffects](https://github.com/filt3rek/feffects) for tweening should also be compatible with as2 haxe ( flash8 )?

- http://old.haxe.org/forum - Old haxe forum more likely to have as2 haxe related details, my old answers were under jlm
- https://code.google.com/archive/p/actionscripttohaxe/ May have dependancies.
- **Last Haxe version supporting flash8 ( as2 )** https://haxe.org/download/version/3.1.3/
- To support flash 6/7 swf you will probably need haxe 1.9.
